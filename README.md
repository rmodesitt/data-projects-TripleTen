# TripleTen data science projects
I completed an 8-month Data Science coding bootcamp through the TripleTen program. This repository represents a compilation of several data science and analysis projects that I completed in finishing the program. The
projects solve real-world problems, and exemplify my growing skills as a data scientist and analyst. The projects incorporate many area specializations, ranging from exploratory data analysis, machine learning implementation, 
statistical analysis, predictive modeling, data mining, and much more!
