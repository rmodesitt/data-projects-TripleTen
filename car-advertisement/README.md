# Car sales and market dashboard

This project provides key insights and visualizations into car sales and marketing details through the interaction with a web dashboard. An interactive web 
application was developed and deployed to a cloud service via <b>Render</b>. The web service was linked to this Github repository, configured, and then deployed for use.
In the dashboard, settings and filters can be applied to find patterns and contrasts between car types, prices, conditions, and much more. See below for the URL link.

<b>NOTE:</b> In order to run the application locally you will need:

- Virtual environment, such as Anaconda Navigator (https://www.anaconda.com/download)
- Open CMD.exe prompt in Anaconda Navigator
- Install streamlit (pip install streamlit)
- Change directories (CD file path location)
- Tun the app file (streamlit run app.py)

### Project plan
