# Car market analysis
The content of this repository contains analysis and the components for data visualizations for car advertisement data from the vehicles.us.csv dataset. It explores, compares, and contrasts the differences in different car types, their prices, condition, and much more. 

There is a Jupyter notebook in the <b>notebooks</b> directory that provides data and visual analysis of the car dataset. There is also a python script named *app.py* that is used to view some of the data visualizations from a web application via Streamlit and Render.

Here is a link to the web app via Render: https://car-market-analysis.onrender.com/
