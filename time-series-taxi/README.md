# Taxi order forecast

The Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports for the previous 6 months. To attract more drivers during peak hours, they have requested a model that predicts the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. If taxi drivers have 
the knowledge on what hours will be very busy, this will ultimately attract more drivers. The threshold of the model must yield a RMSE metric not more than <b>48</b>.

### Project plan

- Download the data and resample it by one hour
- Analyze the data
- Train different models with different hyperparameters. Select the best model
- Perform final testing and evaluation

### Project notebook
This is a Jupyter notebook of the analysis and model building.
