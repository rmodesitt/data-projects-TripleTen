# Car sales analysis and future planning

Rusty Bargain used car sales service wants to develop an app to attract new customers. An important feature in the app includes the ability to quickly find 
out the market value of a customer's car. Using historical data on previous used cars, the goal is to build a model to determine the value of a used car,

prediction, and the time required for training.
