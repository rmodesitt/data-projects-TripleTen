<p align='left'>Predicting future customer behaviors at Beta Bank
  
Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. Instead of using a lot of effort, energy, and money to replace these customers, the bankers figured out it’s cheaper to try and keep their business. Therefore, it has been requested to present analysis and create a model that helps predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon based on data of the clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. The threshold for an acceptable model is a F1 score of <b>59%</b>.

Project plan

- Download and prepare the data. Explain the procedure

- Improve the quality of the model
  - Use at least two approaches to fixing class imbalance
  - Train different models on training and validation sets
  - Tune and pick the best parameters
- Perform final testing and evaluation
